# Password Generator 

## Description

The Password Generator is a dynamic web application designed to improve security for users across the digital landscape. I was motivated by the need to access/secure sensitive data, this tool provides a customizable and secure means of generating passwords. It solves the problem of creating strong, unique passwords that are essential in protecting online data. Building this project deepened my understanding of JavaScript logic and browser-based interactivity.

## Usage

Use the Password Generator by selecting your criteria for the password and clicking the "Generate" button. Type in your desired password character length as a number between 8 and 128. Confirm which character types to include or not to include in your password. Once finished, your new randomly generated password will appear in the text box area, with your desired length and at least one of each your specified character types.
